# Policy-Innovation-Lab-Snapshot
Website for Policy Innovation Lab course and highlights

## About
This course is designed to introduce concepts of Public Interest Technology over seven weeks. Here at Carnegie Mellon University, Heinz College, we follow a "mini" course schedule for some fast-paced, intensive courses, of which the Policy Innovation Lab is one.

This particular course is modeled after one taught in Fall 2019, which had a special focus on smart cities. Co-taught between Chris Goranson and Karen Lightman, this course was designed to introduce the core concepts of the Policy Innovation Lab, but with a special lense on smart cities (specifically learning an agile methodology, applying concepts from user-centered design, developing prototypes and finally, delivering an MVP).

## Course Takeaway
The course will apply some methodologies commonplace in industry like agile, design-thinking, and open source to deliver products and services that have the potential to live on beyond the course.

### Strategy and methodolgy
Identify how innovation in government can benefit from agile methodologies and iterative design strategies. Develop and document an MVP and complete a clean handoff to the partner.

### Cross-disciplinary collaboration
Apply agile and lean methods to make cross-disciplinary teams and government partner interactions functional and valuable.

### Research and prototyping
Understand how to conduct user research to inform a better experience for citizens. and how to prototype solutions quickly, test them, and repeat the process with stakeholder involvement.
